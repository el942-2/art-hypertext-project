        <h1>Path of Shadows 2.0</h1>
        
        <p>A flickering oil lamp illuminates the hidden scroll, detailing your next contract. The air is thick with the scent of rain and old paper. As the ninja, your duty is to eliminate a target within the corrupt capital, but the path ahead is a fragmented, uncertain tapestry of loyalty and shadow.</p>
        
        <p class="accent-element">This interactive space attempts to blend a sleek, modern, digital aesthetic with cultural elements, reflecting a dual identity.</p>

        <p>The night stretches before you, silent and cold. You have reached the crossroads of the river market. How will you proceed?</p>
        
        <ul class="choices">
            <li><a href="pages/page2.html">Choice A: **Silence.** Follow the rooftops, using the ancient, winding paths that skirt the city's electric lights.</a></li>
            <li><a href="pages/page3.html">Choice B: **Subtlety.** Disguise yourself as a river merchant and blend into the bustling, noisy night market crowds.</a></li>
            <li><a href="pages/page4.html">Choice C: **Directness.** Use the main access road, relying on speed and your training to bypass the visible patrols.</a></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="accent-element">The story continues on the path you choose.</p>

        <h1>PATH OF SHADOWS // V2.0</h1>
        
        <p>This is a rework of a prior hypertext narrative, implemented to better capture an expressive vision through intentional design. [cite_start]It combines the modern, sleek design language of the "Silver Drift" project [cite: 9] [cite_start]with decorative elements that speak to Asian identity[cite: 6, 7].</p>
        
        <p class="accent-element">The fragmented structure begins now. The ninja must move.</p>

        <p>You find yourself on the rooftops, overlooking the target's compound. Below, there are three possible infiltration points. The clock is ticking. You must choose:</p>
        
        <ul class="choices">
            <li><a href="page2.html">Infiltrate through the **Lower Garden** and the koi pond. (RISK: High exposure)</a></li>
            <li><a href="page3.html">Enter via the **East Wing Balcony**, scaling the rain-slicked tile. (RISK: Limited time)</a></li>
            <li><a href="page4.html">Wait by the **Main Gate Service Entrance**, hoping a delivery opens the way. (RISK: Delay)</a></li>
        </ul>
        
        [cite_start]<p>This increased interactivity and complexity aligns with the format observed in *falseFriends*[cite: 14].</p>
